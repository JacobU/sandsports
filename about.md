Grades and Mixed Competitions

Our beach netball competition is currently mixed only, however you can have all girls if you want to. There are only three guys allowed on the court at any one time in mixed netball. Our beach volleyball competition consists of many grades from beginner to competitive so there is sure to be a grade to suit your ability.

Scoring & Ladder Position

The following points are credited to each team for each game:

Win : 4 Points
Draw : 2 Points
Loss : 1 Point
Forfeit : 0 Points
No Call No Show: -4 Points


This system is used to discourage teams from forfeiting. Teams are ranked on the ladder according to the number of points they have. If a tiebreaker is needed, percentage is used. In netball, percentage is made up of your total for and against score across all your games. In volleyball, it is made up of sets won against sets lost.

The following method is used to determine the sets score for volleyball. Games are played as much as can be to 21 on all sets on non-final nights. If the set score is 1-1 then the deciding set is immediately live and a team only needs to be 1 point in front at full time to win.
Finals

At the end of the 10 week regular season, the top four teams in each grade make the finals. The finals are played the following week, with first place playing fourth and second playing third in the semi-finals. The two semi-final winners then go on to play in the grand final, which is played on the same night. So you potentially have to play two games on finals night. Volleyball finals are untimed, so to win you must win two sets, and if the game goes to a deciding third set, you must win by two points. Aside from this, normal rules apply.

Byes/XXX Games

If your team is in a grade that has odd numbers, it will be necessary to give you a bye or XXX game 1-2 times per season. If you see 'XXX', as your opposition, then it is your turn for a bye. For this game, you will get an automatic win, and you can either show up at the allotted time and we will find another team to have a scratch match against, or you can have the night off. Please let us know what you want to do when you see a XXX game, so we can plan ahead.
Forfeits

We understand that from time to time, you will have things on that will prevent you from being able to make your game. But please consider that your opposition need someone to play against, and inform us as early as possible that you can't make it, and we will make arrangements to replace you. If you don't have a full team, please still come down because there are always people who will fill in.
